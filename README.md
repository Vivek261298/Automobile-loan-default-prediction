A non-banking financial institution (NBFI) or non-bank financial company (NBFC) is a Financial Institution that does not have a full banking license or is not supervised by a national or international banking regulatory agency. NBFC facilitates bank-related financial services, such as investment, risk pooling, contractual savings, and market brokering.

An NBFI is struggling to mark profits due to an increase in defaults in the vehicle loan category. The company aims to determine the client’s loan repayment abilities and understand the relative importance of each parameter contributing to a borrower’s ability to repay the loan.
